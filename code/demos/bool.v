(** * Working with Decidable Properties *)
(* From the logic.v chapter of Software Foundations*)
(** We've seen two different ways of expressing logical claims in Coq:
    with _booleans_ (of type [bool]), and with _propositions_ (of type
    [Prop]).

    Here are the key differences between [bool] and [Prop]:

                                           bool     Prop
                                           ====     ====
           decidable?                      yes       no
           useable with match?             yes       no
           works with rewrite tactic?      no        yes
*)

(** The crucial difference between the two worlds is _decidability_.
    Every (closed) Coq expression of type [bool] can be simplified in a
    finite number of steps to either [true] or [false] -- i.e., there is a
    terminating mechanical procedure for deciding whether or not it is
    [true].

    This means that, for example, the type [nat -> bool] is inhabited only
    by functions that, given a [nat], always yield either [true] or [false]
    in finite time; and this, in turn, means (by a standard computability
    argument) that there is _no_ function in [nat -> bool] that checks
    whether a given number is the code of a terminating Turing machine.

    By contrast, the type [Prop] includes both decidable and undecidable
    mathematical propositions; in particular, the type [nat -> Prop] does
    contain functions representing properties like "the nth Turing machine
    halts."

    The second row in the table follows directly from this essential
    difference.  To evaluate a pattern match (or conditional) on a boolean,
    we need to know whether the scrutinee evaluates to [true] or [false];
    this only works for [bool], not [Prop].

    The third row highlights another important practical difference:
    equality functions like [eqb_nat] that return a boolean cannot be used
    directly to justify rewriting with the [rewrite] tactic; propositional
    equality is required for this. *)

(** Since [Prop] includes _both_ decidable and undecidable properties, we
    have two choices when we want to formalize a property that happens to
    be decidable: we can express it either as a boolean computation or as a
    function into [Prop]. *)

Example even_42_bool : even 42 = true.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** ... or that there exists some [k] such that [n = double k]. *)
Example even_42_prop : Even 42.
Proof. unfold Even. exists 21. reflexivity. Qed.

(** Of course, it would be pretty strange if these two
    characterizations of evenness did not describe the same set of
    natural numbers!  Fortunately, we can prove that they do... *)

(** We first need two helper lemmas. *)
Lemma even_double : forall k, even (double k) = true.
Proof.
  intros k. induction k as [|k' IHk'].
  - reflexivity.
  - simpl. apply IHk'.
Qed.

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard (even_double_conv) *)
Lemma even_double_conv : forall n, exists k,
  n = if even n then double k else S (double k).
Proof.
  intros n.
  induction n as [| n' IHn].
  - simpl. exists 0. reflexivity.
  - rewrite even_S.
    destruct (even n') eqn:HnEven.
    + simpl.
      inversion IHn.
      exists x.
      f_equal.
      apply H.
    + simpl.
      inversion IHn as [k nEqSucc].
      rewrite nEqSucc.
      exists (S k).
      rewrite double_incr.
      reflexivity.
Qed.
(** [] *)

(** Now the main theorem: *)
Theorem even_bool_prop : forall n,
  even n = true <-> Even n.
Proof.
  intros n. split.
  - intros H. destruct (even_double_conv n) as [k Hk].
    rewrite Hk. rewrite H. exists k. reflexivity.
  - intros [k Hk]. rewrite Hk. apply even_double.
Qed.

(** In view of this theorem, we can say that the boolean computation
    [even n] is _reflected_ in the truth of the proposition
    [exists k, n = double k]. *)

(** Similarly, to state that two numbers [n] and [m] are equal, we can
    say either
      - (1) that [n =? m] returns [true], or
      - (2) that [n = m].
    Again, these two notions are equivalent: *)

Theorem eqb_eq : forall n1 n2 : nat,
  n1 =? n2 = true <-> n1 = n2.
Proof.
  intros n1 n2. split.
  - apply eqb_true.
  - intros H. rewrite H. rewrite eqb_refl. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** Even when the boolean and propositional formulations of a claim are
    interchangeable from a purely logical perspective, it can be more
    convenient to use one over the other. *)

(** For example, there is no effective way to _test_ whether or not a
    [Prop] is true in a function definition; as a consequence, the
    following definition is rejected: *)

Fail
Definition is_even_prime n :=
  if n = 2 then true
  else false.

(** Coq complains that [n = 2] has type [Prop], while it expects an
    element of [bool] (or some other inductive type with two elements).
    This has to do with the _computational_ nature of Coq's core language,
    which is designed so that every function it can express is computable
    and total.  One reason for this is to allow the extraction of
    executable programs from Coq developments.  As a consequence, [Prop] in
    Coq does _not_ have a universal case analysis operation telling whether
    any given proposition is true or false, since such an operation would
    allow us to write non-computable functions.  *)

(** Rather, we have to state this definition using a boolean equality
    test. *)

Definition is_even_prime n :=
  if n =? 2 then true
  else false.

(** Beyond the fact that non-computable properties are impossible in
    general to phrase as boolean computations, even many _computable_
    properties are easier to express using [Prop] than [bool], since
    recursive function definitions in Coq are subject to significant
    restrictions.  For instance, the next chapter shows how to define the
    property that a regular expression matches a given string using [Prop].
    Doing the same with [bool] would amount to writing a regular expression
    matching algorithm, which would be more complicated, harder to
    understand, and harder to reason about than a simple (non-algorithmic)
    definition of this property.

    Conversely, an important side benefit of stating facts using booleans
    is enabling some proof automation through computation with Coq terms, a
    technique known as _proof by reflection_.

    Consider the following statement: *)

Example even_1000 : Even 1000.

(** The most direct way to prove this is to give the value of [k]
    explicitly. *)

Proof. unfold Even. exists 500. reflexivity. Qed.

(** The proof of the corresponding boolean statement is simpler, because we
    don't have to invent the witness [500]: Coq's computation mechanism
    does it for us! *)

Example even_1000' : even 1000 = true.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** Now, the useful observation is that, since the two notions are
    equivalent, we can use the boolean formulation to prove the other one
    without mentioning the value 500 explicitly: *)

Example even_1000'' : Even 1000.
Proof. apply even_bool_prop. reflexivity. Qed.
