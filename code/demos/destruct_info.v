(* The destruct tactic separately considers the cases where n = O and where n = S n'. 
  It generates two subgoals, which are proven separately *)

Theorem add_1_neq_0 : forall n : nat, ((n + 1) =? 0) = false.
Proof.
  intros n.
  destruct n as [| a] eqn:E.
Abort.

(*The annotation "as [| n']" (OPTIONAL) is called an intro pattern. 
  It tells Coq what variable names to introduce in each subgoal. 
  In general, what goes between the square brackets is a list of lists of names, separated by |.
  In this case, the first component is empty, since the O constructor doesn't take any arguments. 
  The second component gives a single name, n', since S is a unary constructor.

Definition everything_is_true (c:colors) := True.

Theorem something_about_colours : forall c:colors, everything_is_true (c)=True.
Proof.

destruct c as [r | g | b].

Theorem something_about_colours : forall c:colors, everything_is_true (c)=True.
Proof.
intros c.
destruct c.
Abort.

(*   The eqn:E annotation (OPTIONAL) tells destruct to give the name E to this equation.  
The - signs on the second and third lines are called bullets, 
and they mark the parts of the proof that correspond to the two generated subgoals.

Proof.

  - simpl. reflexivity.
  - unfold Init.Nat.add. simpl. reflexivity.

(* Marking cases with bullets is optional
If bullets are marked Coq ensures that a subgoal is complete before moving to the next one *)

(* Besides - and +, we can use Ã— (asterisk) or any repetition of a bullet symbol (e.g. -- ) as a bullet.
It is sometimes useful to invoke destruct inside a subgoal, generating yet more proof obligations. 
In that case, different types of markers are required for different types of sub-goals*)
