# Learnings

This is the repository for saving our learning insights from the `BI Coq'ers United` sessions.


## What's this about

In this repo we'll keep insights, examples and ressource for learning Coq. 
In particular it contains things we presented during the weekly Coq meeting. 
To make it easier for us to a) build examples for tactics/strategies an problems and b) step through the examples afterwards
we'll have a little library with helper functions, datatype mocks etc. to build examples that make the examples in here standalone as for as possible i.e. please don't add (unneccesary dependencies)
